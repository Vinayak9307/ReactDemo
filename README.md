# My React App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of React Router for navigation between different components. The application consists of four main tabs: "Get All Shares," "Search," "Update," and "Delete." Each tab is implemented as a separate component, and the application utilizes a custom hook for fetching share data.

## Features

- **Get All Shares**: Displays a table of all shares fetched from an API.
- **Search**: Provides an interface for users to search for specific shares based on criteria.
- **Update**: Allows users to update share details through a form.
- **Delete**: Enables users to delete shares by providing an identifier.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router v7.7.1
- Custom Hooks
- Basic CSS for styling
